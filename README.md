# Background 
I’ve been on the 30 Days of Learning organized by some Microsoft MVPs and just like the saying goes “there is no point to learning if there is no practice to it”, Airline Delay analysis was carried out in fulfillment of one of the projects we are to work in completion of the 30 Days of Learning.

This analysis answer questions such as:

* number of Arline
* number of Flights; delayed flights and not delayed flights
* rate of flight delay by airline
* number of passengers per airline
* rate of flight delay by weekday
* total length, time and flight travelled by each airline

# Data Collection

The data was provided by the 30DaysOfLearning instructors in a GitHub folder, the origin of the dataset can be further traced to Kaggle. The dataset can also be gotten Here.

# Data Preparation

The data was connected to directly from Microsoft Excel where the dataset was skimmed through for understanding of the data.
