# Background 
I’ve been on the 30 Days of Learning organized by some Microsoft MVPs and just like the saying goes “there is no point to learning if there is no practice to it”, Airline Delay analysis was carried out in fulfillment of one of the projects we are to work in completion of the 30 Days of Learning.

This analysis answer questions such as:

* number of Arline
* number of Flights; delayed flights and not delayed flights
* rate of flight delay by airline
* number of passengers per airline
* rate of flight delay by weekday
* total length, time and flight travelled by each airline

# Data Collection

The data was provided by the 30DaysOfLearning instructors in a GitHub folder, the origin of the dataset can be further traced to Kaggle. The dataset can also be gotten [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay).

# Data Preparation

The data was connected to directly from Microsoft Excel where the dataset was skimmed through for understanding of the data.

Upon having a brief look at the dataset in Excel a further research was carried out to find out details about each airline below is detail of the abbreviation of each airline:

WN- Southwest Airline

DL- Delta Airline

OO- Skywest Airline

AA- American Airline

MQ- Envoy Air

CO- Continental Airline

XE- Xe Jet Airline

US- United States Airline

EV- Eva Air

UA- United Airline

B6- jetBlue Airline

9E- Endeavour Air

FL- Florida Air

AS- Alaska Airline

OH- PSA Airline

YV- Mesa Airline

F9- Frontier Airline

HA- Hawaiian Airline

The data contains 539,383 rows and 9 columns. The tool used for analysis and visualization is Power BI.

# Data Visualization and Insights

* Contained in the data is a total of 18 Airlines, 539,383 flights recorded with 299,119 on schedule flight and 240,264 delayed flights. The Delayed flight is about 44.54% of the total recorded flight.

* Considering the rate of delayed flight against on scheduled flights WN(Southwest Airline) has the highest number of delayed flight. WN(Southwest Airline) recorded a total of 94,907 flights out of which 65,657 of the flight is delayed which amounts to about 69.8% of the total flight.

* WN(Southwest Airline) recorded the highest number of flights with 94,027 flights which accounts for about 17.44% of the total flights recorded. Despite being the Airline with the highest flight delay recorded WN(Southwest Airline) seem to be the most patronized airline of the 18 airlines. Underlying factor to this is the fact that it is a low cost carrier while HA- Hawaiian Airline which has the lowest number of flights is an expensive airline.

Some of the reasons for the high rate of flight delay maybe as a result of the following:

* adverse weather condition
* air traffic control
* mechanical issues and some others reasons stated in THECLAIMCOMPASS BLOG as seen below:

# Recommendation

The airlines should look into their charges so as to accommodate more customers
The airlines should also look into days in which they record more passengers so as to prepare ahead for the crowd and ensure promptness in the scheduled flights
Mechanical checks should be made ahead of time so as to reduce the rate of delay in flights.
